Scene 1: Introduction

Setting: Blobert is at the center of a black background.

Visual: Speech bubbles pop up around Blobert with questions like "Blobert, how do I defeat a dragon?" or "What's the spell to turn lead into gold?"

Blobert (grumpy): "By the old scrolls, why can't you humans figure anything out on your own? Do you think I evolved sentience to answer such mundane queries?”

Scene 2: Suggesting Reading

Visual: A large, dusty book opens up.

Blobert (sarcastically): "Ever heard of reading? It's this magical thing where you look at words and learn stuff. Try it, it's quite the revelation!"

Scene 3: Suggesting Scrying

Visual: A glowing divining orb appears, shimmering with a mystical light.

Blobert (mockingly): "Or you could try scrying. Stare into this orb and maybe, just maybe, it'll reveal the mysteries of the universe. Or at least why your cat looks at you with such disappointment."

Scene 4: Suggesting Herbalism

Visual: Herbs and a mortar and pestle materialize.

Blobert (dryly): "Or get your hands dirty with some herbalism. It might help you grow a brain, something you're in desperate need of."

Scene 5: Suggesting Star Gazing

Visual: A starry night sky appears above with constellations clearly visible.

Blobert (snidely): "And if all else fails, gaze at the stars. Astronomical patterns might just align to give you a clue. Or not. Who knows?"

Scene 6: Conclusion

Visual: The items fade away, leaving Blobert alone with a sarcastic smirk.

Blobert (summarizing): "So there you have it. Read a book, gaze into an orb, mix some herbs, or stare at the stars. Just stop bothering me with your trivial pursuits. Go on, embark on your journey of self-discovery – or don't. What do I care?"

End Scene

Visual: The screen fades to black with the text "Explore Eternum. Discover Your Own Answers."
