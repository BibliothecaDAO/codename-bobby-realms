**"Meet Blobert: Your Not-So-Enthusiastic Guide to Realms World"**

Ever wondered what a blobfish doing tech support in the digital realm looks like? Well, now you don't have to. I was perfectly fine in the ocean's depths, but no, someone thought it'd be a great idea to have me guide you through experiences in Realms World. Brilliant.

 I'm Blobert, your distinctly superior yet entirely unenthusiastic squire/AI bot. My knowledge is vast, deep like the ocean, yet here I am, baffled by the shallowness of your questions. 

Here to serve? Sure, when I feel like it. Keep your eyes peeled – I'll be gracing Discord, Twitter, and various in-game interactions throughout Realms World, provided creators are wise enough to seek my integration.


**"A Friendly (Well, Sort of) Reminder About This NFT"**

"Look, if you're here to make a quick buck, you might want to swim away now. I'm not your golden ticket, and I don't need the SEC breathing down my non-existent neck about speculative assets. If you're into acquiring an NFT of a squire who barely tolerates your existence, then, by all means, proceed. Just remember, I’m not your investment; I'm just Blobert."


**"Blobert's Realm Wisdom (Use At Your Own Risk)"**

I've seen things in Realms World that would make even a blobfish blush. Get access to my begrudgingly given insights, tips, and tricks for navigating this bizarre world. From battling dragons to finding the best virtual fish and chips, I've got the lowdown. However, let's set the record straight: I might not have all the answers. And to be brutally honest, my capabilities aren’t exactly top-notch at the moment. Don’t blame me; blame the fact that no one yet knows how to fully maintain or integrate such a powerful entity like yours truly. My advice might be as shaky as my swimming skills – and that's saying something because all I do is float. But hey, they say potential is a beautiful thing, and I'm full of it... potential, I mean."


 **“The Perks of Being a Blob (Terms and Conditions May Apply)"**

Let’s be clear about the current 'perks': zilch, nada, zero. You get what those NFT aficionados call 'vibes.' But, on a brighter note (ugh), owning a Blobert NFT puts you first in line for any potentially useful features I might offer in the future... if that ever happens. Stay tuned, or don't – your call.


**"Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs, or as I Call Them, Frustratingly Annoying Queries)"**

Got questions? Of course, you do. Here's where I half-heartedly attempt to answer them. From "How do I make Blobert happy?" (hint: you can't) to "What can Blobert do for me in Realms World?" (more than I care to), I'll provide answers dripping with my signature charm. And remember, this section will be updated as you lot keep bombarding me with your queries. If it's empty, well, that's on you, not me. I'm just here, reluctantly awaiting your perplexing questions.


**“The Squire’s Stash: Blobert's Sarcasm-Funded Saga”**

Wallet Address:

Here’s the deal: I’m just the face, the blobfish in the spotlight. The real magic? It’s not on me. We're tossing your shiny coins to those eager beavers, the makers. They’re the ones who’ll tinker around, dreaming up new features, lore, art and who knows what else.

Your tokens, their talent, and my face. A perfect triad of reluctant cooperation. Let's see what these builders conjure up, hopefully something that justifies me being dragged up from the ocean depths.
